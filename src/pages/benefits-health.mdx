# Health Insurance Benefits

All of the insurance plans will be administered through your existing Gusto account and advisors are available to assist with choosing the right coverage. All of the insurance programs are voluntary and, after making initial selections, you will be able to make changes during the open enrollment period. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
The open enrollment period is a window of time that happens once a year when you can sign up for health insurance, adjust your current plan or cancel your plan. It’s usually limited to a few weeks. If you miss it, you may have to wait until the next open enrollment period to make any changes.
