# Travel

Origin uses Navan as our unified travel platform for booking flights, hotel, and rental cars. Navan includes all airlines, hotel brands, and car rental companies in one location. All of your personal information is stored and booking is super easy. You no longer have a go to the actual airline or travel website. You can book online yourself, have a case manager book travel, or contact a live booking agent to help. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
Make sure all of your information is accurate and complete in your Navan profile because this is the information used to book travel. Don't forget to include your known traveler number if you have TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. Also, you can enter all of your rewards program details in your profile so you can earn points across the board on flights, hotels, and rental cars that you can use for personal travel.
