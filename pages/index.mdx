## Purpose of the Manual of Policy and Procedure
This manual of policy and procedure is presented as a matter of information and has been prepared to inform employees about the Agency’s philosophy, employment practices, policies, and the benefits provided to our valued employees, as well as the conduct expected from them. While this manual is not intended to be a book of rules and regulations or a contract, it does include some important guidelines which employees should know. Except for the at-will employment provisions, the manual can be amended at any time.
 
This manual of policy and procedure will not answer every question employees may have, nor would the Agency want to restrict the normal question and answer interchange among us. It is in our person-to-person conversations that we can better know each other, express our views, and work together in a harmonious relationship.
 
We hope this guide will help employees feel comfortable with us. The Agency depends on its employees; their success is our success. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions. Every manager will gladly answer them. We believe employees will enjoy their work and their fellow employees here. We also believe that employees will find the Agency a good place to work.
 
No one other than authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this manual. No statement or promise by a supervisor, manager, or designee is to be interpreted as a change in policy, nor will it constitute an agreement with an employee.
 
Should any provision in this manual be found to be unenforceable and invalid, such a finding does not invalidate the entire manual, but only the subject provision. Nothing in this manual is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or be incompatible with the NLRA.
 
We ask that employees read this guide carefully, become familiar with the Agency and our policies, and refer to it whenever questions arise.
